# Dev Notes

 to run
   local
     set environment variables
       ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT                            Development (currently set in launchsettings.json)
       APPSETTING_ConfigurationStorageConnectionString   storage account containing config tables (can be emulator)

    note: Config TableStorage PartitionKey locally must be `Development`, rather than `LOCAL`

## Todo

* our configed salt for decoding the hash of the public account legal entity id is fae3#l%V*wGe,
 but that salt isn't in the config for any other service!
 sfa.das.encoding uses a different salt for public account legal entity id.
 get to the bottom of the discrepancy, and either use sfa.das.encoding with their salt
 or extend sfa.das.encoding with the 2nd? public salt!!!

* ask devops to have separate build & release for portal solution

* with the current project structure, we should be able to move all of SFA.DAS.EAS.Portal into SFA.DAS.EAS.Portal.Worker

* issue with singleton webjob in AT:
actually, it's behaving as it's been told - only 1 instance of the job at once, but each host kicks off the job
we can probably leave as is, as the webjob is idempotent, but we could clean it up so that it only runs in 1 host

* it would be better to have a webjob to periodically clean-up processed messages

* unit tests for infrastructure

* how to see & trigger individual jobs in v3?
https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/issues/1975

* update sfa.das.nservicebus to use latest nservicebus.newtonsoft.json, so we can use v12 of newtonsoft.json

* functions instead? https://github.com/tmasternak/NServiceBus.Functions

* looks like UseMessageConventions is a bit too inclusive... (consequences?)
 better to use IEvent
 (also would be worthwhile making sure correlationids flow)
