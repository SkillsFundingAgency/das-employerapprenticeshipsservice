                        <p class="govuk-body"><abbr>ESFA</abbr>’s responsibility through the service is to direct funds for apprenticeships, so the employer agreement covers our complete liability for this. The employer’s responsibility is far wider. For example, employing an apprentice, supporting the successful delivery of the apprenticeship, being responsible for instructing who receives funds and what they purchase. It would therefore not be acceptable to expose <abbr>ESFA</abbr> to any legal or financial risk arising from the employer’s activities.</p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"><abbr>ESFA</abbr> is not doing anything which could give rise to any risk for the employer, so this provision does not apply equally to both parties. As a public sector organisation, <abbr>ESFA</abbr> has a responsibility to manage taxpayers’ money effectively, and it would be imprudent to agree to accept any risk from the activities of the employer in this situation. The Crown must, however, apply proper and reasonable care when enforcing this agreement. While a number of organisations have raised this concern, <abbr>ESFA</abbr>’s responsibility is often taken into account when employers decide to sign the agreement.</p>
                        <p class="govuk-body"><abbr>ESFA</abbr> makes funding available for apprenticeship training, which the employer can choose to take advantage of or not. <abbr>ESFA</abbr> do not think it would be appropriate to be exposed to any legal or financial risk arising from the activities of the employer, as a consequence of making that funding available to them.</p>
