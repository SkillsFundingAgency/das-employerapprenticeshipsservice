        <h2 id="8"><span class="number">8. </span>Withholding, Suspension and repayment of Funding</h2>
        <h3>8.1</h3>
        <p>Without prejudice to the ESFA's other rights and remedies, the ESFA may at its discretion withhold or suspend payment of funds from the Employer's Digital Account if:</p>
        <ol type="a" class="list letters">
            <li>the ESFA becomes aware of any fraud or financial irregularity by the Employer, a Connected Employer or the Training Provider in connection with this Agreement; </li>
            <li>any employee or other individual carrying out activities on behalf of the Employer or a Connected Employer has (a) acted dishonestly or negligently at any time in connection with this Agreement or (b) taken any actions which, in the reasonable opinion of the ESFA, bring or are likely to bring the ESFA's name or reputation into disrepute;</li>
            <li>the Employer or a Connected Employer provides the ESFA with any materially misleading or inaccurate information;</li>
            <li>the Employer or a Connected Employer commits or committed a Prohibited Act;</li>

            <li>the Employer fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement (including requirements in the Funding Rules) and fails to rectify any such failure within 30 days of receiving written notice detailing the failure; or</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>8.2</h3>
        <p>The ESFA reserves the right to recover from the Employer any Funding paid to a Training Provider from the Employer's Digital Account where the payment of Funding or any arrangement between the Employer and the Training Provider does not comply with the Funding Rules. The ESFA will act reasonably and proportionately in exercising its discretion to recover any sum from the Employer under this clause.</p>
        <h3>8.3</h3>
        <p>Where the Employer is a Receiving Employer, it shall pay back any amounts to ESFA which are deemed to be unlawful State aid (together with any interest applied by order of the competent authority assessing the aid to be unlawful).</p>
        <h3>8.4</h3>
        <p>The ESFA may retain or set off any sums owed to it by the Employer which have fallen due and payable against any sums due to the Employer under this Agreement or any other agreement pursuant to which the Employer provides goods or services to the ESFA.</p>
        <h3>8.5</h3>
        <p>The Employer shall make any payments due to the ESFA without any deduction whether by way of set-off, counterclaim, discount, abatement or otherwise.</p>
        <h3>8.6</h3>
        <p>Should the Employer be subject to financial or other difficulties which are capable of having a material impact on its ability to comply with its obligations under this Agreement it will notify the ESFA as soon as possible so that, if possible, and without creating any legal obligation, the ESFA will have an opportunity to provide assistance in resolving the problem or to take action to protect the ESFA and any Funding spent from the Employer's Digital Account.</p>

        <h2 id="9"><span class="number">9. </span>State Aid</h2>
        <h3>9.1</h3>
        <p>Transferred Funds paid on behalf of a Receiving Employer will constitute de minimis state aid under Commission Regulation (EU) No 1407/2013 of 18 December 2013 on the applications of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to de minimis aid. The amount of de minimis state aid amounts to 10% of the total Transferred Funds.</p>
        <h3>9.2</h3>
        <p>Where the Employer receives Transferred Funds or is otherwise notified that any Funding paid on its behalf or on behalf of a Connected Employer to a Training Provider constitutes de minimis state aid, the Employer must keep a record of all de minimis state aid received (from any source) during the current and two previous financial years and notify the ESFA if it has any reason to believe it may have received or is at risk of receiving more than their permitted allowance of de minimis state aid over any three consecutive financial years. (Further requirements relating to state aid are set out in the Funding Rules.)</p>

        <h2 id="10"><span class="number">10.</span> Information, Audit and Reporting</h2>
        <h3>10.1</h3>
        <p>The Employer shall, upon request, supply any documents, information, data, reports, accounts, records or written or verbal explanations which may be reasonably required by the ESFA or its authorised representatives or auditors in connection with this Agreement or the Apprenticeship Service, including in relation to any Apprentice or PAYE scheme of the Employer or any Connected Employer. </p>
        <h3>10.2</h3>
        <p>The Employer shall assist and cooperate with the ESFA in relation to any audit or investigation and shall grant the ESFA or its authorised representatives or auditors access to its premises at any reasonable time, with or without notice, to examine, remove and/or copy any relevant documents and records (including electronic records) and to interview the Employer's and any Connected Employer's employees or staff carrying out activities in connection with this Agreement or any Apprentice receiving Training under this Agreement.</p>
