            <li>have a contract for services with a Training Provider for the provision of Training to one or more Apprentices; and</li>

        <h3>6.1</h3>
        <p>The Employer agrees to pay the Training Provider directly for any Employer Co-Investment which is or becomes payable in accordance with the Funding Rules.</p>
        <h3>6.2</h3>
        <p>Where the Employer's liability to pay an Employer Co-Investment occurs after the cost of Training has been paid in full from the Employer's Digital Account, (for example, where a change in the Employer or a Connected Employer's tax liability reduces the amount of funds that were previously in the Employer's Digital Account), the Employer agrees to pay the Employer's Co-Investment to the SFA upon request.</p>

        <h3>7.1</h3>
        <p>Without prejudice to the SFA's other rights and remedies, the SFA may at its discretion withhold or suspend payment of funds from the Employer's Digital Account if:</p>
        <ol type="a" class="list letters">
            <li>the SFA becomes aware of any fraud or financial irregularity by the Employer, a Connected Employer or the Training Provider in connection with this Agreement; </li>
            <li>any employee or other individual carrying out activities on behalf of the Employer or a Connected Employer has (a) acted dishonestly or negligently at any time in connection with this Agreement or (b) taken any actions which, in the reasonable opinion of the SFA, bring or are likely to bring the SFA's name or reputation into disrepute;</li>
            <li>the Employer or a Connected Employer provides the SFA with any materially misleading or inaccurate information;</li>
            <li>the Employer or a Connected Employer commits or committed a Prohibited Act;</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>7.2</h3>
        <p>The SFA reserves the right to recover from the Employer any Funding paid to a Training Provider from the Employer's Digital Account where the payment of Funding or any arrangement between the Employer and the Training Provider does not comply with the Funding Rules. The SFA will act reasonably and proportionately in exercising its discretion to recover any sum from the Employer under this clause.</p>
        <h3>7.3</h3>
        <p>The SFA may retain or set off any sums owed to it by the Employer which have fallen due and payable against any sums due to the Employer under this Agreement or any other agreement pursuant to which the Employer provides goods or services to the SFA.</p>
        <h3>7.4</h3>
        <p>The Employer shall make any payments due to the SFA without any deduction whether by way of set-off, counterclaim, discount, abatement or otherwise.</p>
        <h3>7.5</h3>
        <p>Should the Employer be subject to financial or other difficulties which are capable of having a material impact on its ability to comply with its obligations under this Agreement it will notify the SFA as soon as possible so that, if possible, and without creating any legal obligation, the SFA will have an opportunity to provide assistance in resolving the problem or to take action to protect the SFA and any Funding spent from the Employer's Digital Account.</p>
        <h2 id="8"><span class="number">8. </span>State Aid</h2>
        <p>Where the Employer is notified that any Funding paid on its behalf or on behalf of a Connected Employer to a Training Provider constitutes <em>de minimis </em>state aid, the Employer must keep a record of all <em>de minimis </em>state aid received during the current and two previous financial years (from any source) and notify the SFA if it has any reason to believe it may have received or is at risk of receiving more than their permitted allowance of <em>de minimis</em> state aid over any three consecutive financial years. (Further information on state aid is set out in the Funding Rules.)</p>
        <h2 id="9"><span class="number">9.</span> Information, Audit and Reporting</h2>
        <h3>9.1</h3>
        <p>The Employer shall, upon request, supply any documents, information, data, reports, accounts, records or written or verbal explanations which may be reasonably required by the SFA or its authorised representatives or auditors in connection with this Agreement or the Apprenticeship Service, including in relation to any Apprentice or PAYE scheme of the Employer or any Connected Employer. </p>
        <h3>9.2</h3>
        <p>The Employer shall assist and cooperate with the SFA in relation to any audit or investigation and shall grant the SFA or its authorised representatives or auditors access to its premises at any reasonable time, with or without notice, to examine, remove and/or copy any relevant documents and records (including electronic records) and to interview the Employer's and any Connected Employer's employees or staff carrying out activities in connection with this Agreement or any Apprentice receiving Training under this Agreement.</p>
        <h2 id="10"><span class="number">10.</span> Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <h3>10.1</h3>
        <p>The SFA and the Employer agree that all rights, title and interest in or to any information, data, reports, documents, procedures, forecasts, technology, Know-How and any other Intellectual Property Rights whatsoever owned by either the SFA or the Employer before the Commencement Date or developed by either party during the Grant Period, shall remain the property of that party.</p>
        <h3>10.2</h3>

        <h3>11.2</h3>
        <p>The obligation of confidentiality contained in this clause shall not apply or shall cease to apply to any Intellectual Property Rights, Know-How or other business, technical or commercial information which:</p>
        <ol type="a" class="list letters">
            <li>at the time of its disclosure by the disclosing party is already in the public domain or which subsequently enters the public domain other than by breach of the terms of this Agreement by the receiving party;</li>
            <li>is already known to the receiving party as evidenced by written records at the time of its disclosure by the disclosing party and was not otherwise acquired by the receiving party from the disclosing party under any obligations of confidence; or</li>
            <li>is at any time after the date of this Agreement acquired by the receiving party from a third party having the right to disclose the same to the receiving party without breach of the obligations owed by that party to the disclosing party.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>11.3</h3>
