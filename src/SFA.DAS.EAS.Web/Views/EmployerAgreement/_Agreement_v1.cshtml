            having a material impact on its ability to comply with its obligations under this
            Agreement it will notify the SFA as soon as possible so that, if possible, and without creating any legal obligation, the SFA will have an opportunity to provide assistance
            in resolving the problem or to take action to protect the SFA and any Funding spent
            from the Employer’s Digital Account.
